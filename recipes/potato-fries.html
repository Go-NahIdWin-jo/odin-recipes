    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>French fries (North American English), chips (British English and other national varieties), finger chips (Indian English), french-fried potatoes, or simply fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Wikipedia)</a></p>
